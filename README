PURPOSE

    Sidebar in a Can adapts the Snippets technology to allow administrators to
    create a Netscape sidebar linking in to a store of pre-existing content.
    This presents visitors with a starting point in content-heavy sites that
    leave a visitor wondering where to begin.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP

    Basics

        The setup procedure is slightly different depending on
        whether you want to install a new copy of Sidebar in a Can, or
        upgrade an existing one.

            * If you have an existing Sidebar in a Can installation which you'd
              like to upgrade, run "./upgrade" to upgrade your
              installation while preserving data that already exist.

            --OR--

            * If you have not installed Sidebar in a Can before, run
              "./install" and answer the questions provided.  This will run
              a simplified Unix install script and should create
              a working, out-of-the-box installation when supplied
              appropriate values.

            --THEN--

            * See USAGE below if you need help using Sidebar in a Can.

            * The install script is not meant to fully customize Sidebar in a
              Can, only to get it running.  See Customization below for further
              information on how to adjust Snippets to meet your needs.

            * Security-conscious administrators should read Security
              below.

        Customization

            If Sidebar in a Can is published at
            <the published sidebar URL>
            then the Sidebar in a Can administrative interface is at a URL of
            <the published sidebar URL>?administative
            For instance, if you put up a sidebar at
            http://example.com/sidebar.cgi, you can log in and do
            administrative functions from
            http://example.com/sidebar.cgi?administrative

            The configuration file at
            <the private sidebar data directory>/general/config is
            well-commented and can be adjusted to control how the script
            works.

            The account <the server administrator e-mail you specify>
            initially given password
            <the password generated by the install script> is a special
            account in that it has a page of administrative controls. 
            Many of these controls should explain themselves, but there
            are some non-obvious ways to use them.

            The beginning and ending of a page are read from
            <the private sidebar data directory>/general/header and
            <the private sidebar data directory>/general/footer
            respectively.  Editing those files provides a powerful way to
            customize the script.

            The images used for buttons and for backgrounds are found in
            <the public sidebar HTML directory> and may be replaced with
            images tailored to your site's needs.

            The background provided is a modified background from Netscape's
            background sampler at
            http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/bg/backgrounds.html.

        Optimization

            If you'd like to cut server load and response time, adjust this
            procedure to suit your needs. (Sidebar will work perfectly well
            without it!

            1: Install Sidebar in a Can to work as
               <the published sidebar URL>.
            
            2: Change all references in
               <the private sidebar data directory>/general/header and
               <the private sidebar data directory>/general/footer from
               <the published sidebar URL> to
               <the public sidebar HTML directory>/sidebar.html.
            
            3: Add a crontab entry to be run each minute:
               
               echo "" | <the full path to sidebar> > /tmp/sidebar_$$.html ; cp /tmp/sidebar_$$.html <the public sidebar HTML directory>/sidebar.html

               It is important that the copy follows the sidebar run.
            
            4: Advertise a sidebar URL of
               <the public sidebar HTML directory>/sidebar.html
               and continute to use
               <the published sidebar URL>
               for administrative purposes.
            
            This will ensure one sidebar per site, instead of one sidebar per
            visitor.

        Security

            The present release of Sidebar in a Can  has not been closely
            scrutinized for security, and should be treated as such by
            security-conscious administrators.  If you examine the code
            and discover a vulnerability that could compromise the server,
            please contact the author at jshayward@pobox.com.  The script is
            intended to have light security and not to compromise a server,
            but it is not intended to store credit card numbers or other
            sensitive information.

            The default installation sets
            <the private sidebar data directory> and contents
            to mode 777.  Administrators are encouraged to set
            directory and contents to mode 700, owned by the
            effective user ID that Snippets will be running under.

USAGE

    Sidebar in a Can is designed to be run as a straightforward web
    application, with much administrative activity performed on-web.
    Rather than trying to explain how to use it, I simply encourage you
    to explore.

NOTES

    Payment

        Sidebar in a Can is linkware. It is available to you free of charge.
        If you like it, I would be very happy if you would visit
        http://JonathansCorner.com and consider linking to it.

    Programmer's notes

        The file format for sidebar is extremely simple; it should
        be straightforward to write programs that will import other
        content (i.e. fortune cookie messages) into it.

    Bugs

        For security-related concerns, see Security above.
